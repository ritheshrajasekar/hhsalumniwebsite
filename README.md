# HHS Alumni Website

I developed the HHS Alumni Website to give students from my high school an easy and interactive way to stay connected with their community after graduation. I implemented all the CRUD operations including administrative features for safe and effective use of the data from students. I am currently coordinating with HHS administration to conduct a full go-live for the website.

I used Flask for the back end of the web application with SQLAlchemy and Postgress for storing the student's data. The project is deployed through the Heroku server. In addition, I used AWS S3 buckets to store user profile images. The front end of the web app utilizes HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
